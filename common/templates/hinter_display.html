      <h4>What makes a good hint?</h4>

      <p>It depends on the type of problem you ran into. For stupid errors --
      an arithmetic error or similar -- simply letting the student you'll be
      helping to check their signs is sufficient.</p>

      <p>For deeper errors of understanding, the best hints allow students to
      discover a contradiction in how they are thinking about the
      problem. An example that clearly demonstrates inconsistency or
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" target="_blank"> cognitive dissonace </a>
      is ideal, although in most cases, not possible.</p>

      <p>
        Good hints either:
        <ul>
          <li> Point out the specific misunderstanding your classmate might have </li>
          <li> Point to concepts or theories where your classmates might have a
          misunderstanding </li>
          <li> Show simpler, analogous examples. </li>
          <li> Provide references to relevant parts of the text </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Still, remember even a crude hint -- virtually anything short of
      giving away the answer -- is better than no hint.</p>
